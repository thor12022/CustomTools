This mod allows you to add custom tools to your Minecraft game. It was inspired largely my Tabula Rasa by COFH, and it's config file will look quite purposely similar.

Installing the mod is the same as other Forge mods, drop it into your mods folder and go. It should be compatible with all 1.7.10 Forge versions from 1208 on. If you provide no configuration, it will create a default with one of each supported tool. The default custom tools are very awful, and use a very awful texture. This is on purpose, to make you feel shame every time you use it.

This mod does not (currently) provide a way to configure recipes for the tools, you'll have to do that on your own. I'd recommend MineTweaker or ZZZZZ_CustomConfigs for this purpose.

To add textures to your custom tools, put them in a resource pack, just like you do with Tabula Rasa Items.

If you find a bug, feel free to report it in the GitHub Issue tracker. Alternatively, create a pull request, just note I can be a bit picky about coding style uniformity sometimes.
